## MapShuffle

This app generates random Google maps. If you use the default settings, your map could be centered anywhere on Earth except for polar regions and ocean areas that aren't claimed by any particular country. (...I suspect you won't miss staring at large stretches of ocean and aren't looking for Santa's workshop or anything. :P)

If you feel like walking off to look for America, you can set the app to only generate maps centered within the continental United States, although given the results of the 2016 election, this might get a bit depressing. You can also randomize the zoom level, which might give you a closer look at interesting scenery... or leave you stranded in the middle of uninhabited wilderness!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It was built almost entirely using React, with the help of a few awesome NPM modules (especially [Google-Map-React](https://github.com/istarkov/google-map-react)).
