## MapShuffle

Generates random Google maps, located within the continental United States.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To Do:

- Use reverse geocoding to determine if you're over the ocean or not.
  - (This will allow you to generate maps that aren't centered in the US)
  - (It will also allow you to generate more precise maps)

- Format site to make it look nicer.

- Host site on mapshuffle.com
  - This will require hosting the site on Heroku.
    - This will require uploading things to Github.
